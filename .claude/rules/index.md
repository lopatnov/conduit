# Working rules for this session

> Lean adaptation of a multi-role team template for a solo-maintainer Rust project.
> A few operational disciplines from that template are worth keeping here, tailored to
> what conduit actually does (not generic placeholders).

## Related rule files

- **`conventions.md`** — commits (Conventional Commits + `Co-Authored-By`), SemVer/version
  lockstep, branch naming, push-frequency economy, zero-warnings/English-only bar, PR
  checklist, and the literal CodeRabbit reply/resolve pattern from PR #70.
- **`workflow.md`** — trigger table mapping "what's happening → which subagent to call",
  example walk-throughs (trivial fix / bug fix / feature / release), and session-budget
  discipline. Read this before deciding whether (and which) subagent to spawn.

## Worktree persistence (don't strand uncommitted `.claude/` tooling)

> `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md` are tracked in git, so a worktree created from a *committed*
> branch already has the same tooling as the main checkout. The residual risk is only
> **uncommitted** edits made inside a harness worktree (a real directory, not a junction) —
> those are local to that worktree until committed, same as any other uncommitted file.

- When editing **persist-able `.claude/` tooling** — agents (`.claude/agents/`), commands
  (`.claude/commands/`), skills (`.claude/skills/`), or rule files (`.claude/rules/`) —
  commit the change (even a small WIP commit) before the worktree is cleaned up, so it isn't
  **lost when the worktree is removed**.
- A `Stop` hook may auto-mirror an uncommitted worktree's `.claude/{agents,commands,skills,rules}`
  back to the main checkout (additive, no deletes) as a safety net — but don't rely on it;
  commit directly when you can.
- **`CLAUDE.md` is fine** — it is *not* copied into the worktree (lives only in the
  main repo root), so editing `<projects-root>\conduit\CLAUDE.md` already persists.
  **User memory is fine** too (`<user-home>\.claude\projects\...\memory\`).

## Build discipline

- Run **`/build`** (delegates to `build-validator`) after any non-trivial change, and before
  opening/merging a PR. A commit/PR is only acceptable when the build is green
  (0 errors, 0 warnings under `-D warnings` — see CLAUDE.md "Zero warnings").
- Use `build-validator` to keep raw `cargo`/`rustc` output out of the main context — it
  returns a compact GREEN/RED verdict instead.

## Economy & avoiding CI races

- **`git push` no more than once per hour** by default — avoids spamming CI and creating
  races between PRs. Push more often only when the user explicitly asks.
- Don't spawn agents for trivial edits (typo, rename, one-line fix) — do it directly, then
  `/build`. Agents cost a cold start and re-derive context; reserve them for real expertise,
  noisy-output isolation, or a genuinely autonomous sub-task.
- Prefer finishing what's started over chasing new ideas mid-task — stash new ideas as
  backlog notes (conduit already tracks this in `CLAUDE.md` "Беклог").

## PR review & CI triage

- If a CI check is failing, first look at the **run history for that check** to find the
  commit where it started failing — don't assume the newest commit is the cause.
- Before reporting a failure as a regression: check whether the **same commit** passed on a
  different run. Network/registry blips (`curl failed`, `SSL_read: unexpected eof`,
  `download of <crate> failed`) on crates.io/ghcr.io are common and transient — `gh run rerun
  <id> --failed` rather than treating them as code problems. Only escalate as a real bug if
  the same commit fails consistently across reruns.
- See `release-engineer` (`.claude/agents/release-engineer.md`) for merge-order planning
  across dependent PRs and for driving the actual `v<x.y.z>` tag → release pipeline.

## Subagents available here

- `build-validator` (haiku, read-only) — fmt/clippy/test verdicts, called via `/build`.
- `release-engineer` (sonnet) — release readiness, CI failure triage, merge-order planning,
  driving the tag → `release.yml` pipeline.
- `security-engineer` (sonnet) — auth/secrets/TLS/guard-chain review, scanner-finding triage
  (Dependabot/OSV/Trivy/Semgrep/CodeQL/SonarCloud). Can block Quality/Release on real risk.
- `business-analyst` (sonnet) — turns a vague request/issue into scope + acceptance criteria,
  and checks it against `CLAUDE.md`'s architectural decisions / existing backlog *before* work
  starts (catches duplicates, conflicts with "не пересматривать без обсуждения" rules, and
  stale `[🚫 BLOCKED]` items whose reasons may no longer hold).
- `scrum-master` (sonnet) — manages conduit's backlog *as it actually exists*: `CLAUDE.md`
  checkboxes + dated "Реализовано в сессии" log + GitHub Issues (no separate `.claude/backlog/`
  here — don't invent one). Marks things done, decomposes large asks, tracks multi-PR efforts
  to completion.
- `lawyer` (haiku) — license-compatibility check when a `Cargo.toml` change adds a dependency
  or a new optional feature's crate tree (conduit is Apache-2.0; ships as binary + npm + Docker).
  Can block an incompatible/copyleft dependency.
- `architect` (opus, advisory/read-only) — called when a file crosses the 400/1000-line limits
  (`conventions.md` "Code quality") or for bigger design-decomposition questions. Hands back a
  concrete split/PR-decomposition plan; never edits files itself — the conductor implements it.

### Added for the Conduit 2.0 workspace migration (#114) — `/feature-workspace-cycle`

These exist for the feature-driven Cargo workspace migration cycle, but aren't limited to
it — call them whenever the same shape of task comes up outside that cycle too.

- `dependency-steward` (haiku, read-only) — triages open Dependabot PRs in a batch: semver
  risk, grouping related bumps, CI status, merge/hold recommendation.
- `feature-matrix-runner` (haiku, read-only) — proves Cargo feature gating is actually
  correct (`cargo hack --each-feature --no-dev-deps`, optional powerset), distinct from
  `build-validator`'s single-profile check.
- `footprint-auditor` (haiku, read-only) — measures stripped binary size / dependency count
  per feature profile and diffs against a base ref; the metric the workspace split exists
  to move.
- `integrity-auditor` (sonnet, read-only) — spot-checks that an *already-shipped* feature
  still works as documented: implementation vs. its own tests vs. docs/schema, reporting
  gaps (never fixing them itself). Distinct from self-review (which only covers new diffs).
- `prior-art-researcher` (sonnet) — "how do other proxies/gateways solve this" research
  against the reference projects named in `CLAUDE.md`'s own backlog (h2o, Angie, Envoy,
  HAProxy, traefik, linkerd2-proxy, etc.), with concrete file/line pointers and an explicit
  adapt/don't-adapt call.
- `docs-scribe` (sonnet) — keeps README/`docs/*.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`/
  `schema/conduit.schema.json` in sync with a merged diff.
- `crate-extractor` (sonnet) — **temporary**, retire after #114 Phase 6 — executes one
  mechanical crate-extraction end-to-end from the recipe in `CONTRIBUTING.md`/the pilot PR.

> When in doubt about whether to spawn one of these for a small ask — don't. The conductor
> handles trivial scoping/backlog bookkeeping/license-glance itself; reserve these for when
> the question genuinely needs that role's framing (see "Economy" above).

## Skills available here

- **`testing`** (`.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`) — conduit's actual test idioms (port 0,
  `rcgen`, `serial_test`, raw-`TcpListener` mock upstreams) and where to find canonical
  examples to pattern-match against. Read before writing new tests rather than reinventing
  a mocking approach.
- **`release`** (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`) — the concrete tag → `release.yml` →
  verify-artifacts runbook (version lockstep, Docker manifest checks, transient-failure
  triage). `release-engineer` drives a release from this; the conductor can also follow it
  directly for a quick one.

> `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md` are tracked in git for this repo (not gitignored — they ship
> with the source tree so cloud/remote sessions get the same tooling as local ones) but are
> excluded from the *published crate* via `Cargo.toml` `[package] exclude` — they never end
> up in the `cargo publish` source package or release artifacts.
