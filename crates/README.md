# crates/

Feature crates for the Conduit 2.0 workspace migration (see [#114](https://github.com/lopatnov/conduit/issues/114))
land here — one crate per Cargo feature, extracted incrementally per the phase
plan in that issue. Empty until Phase 2 (#126, `conduit-core`).

Each crate is named `lopatnov-conduit-<name>` and inherits shared metadata
(`version`, `edition`, `license`, `repository`) from `[workspace.package]` in
the root `Cargo.toml` via `<field>.workspace = true`.
